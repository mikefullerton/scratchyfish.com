We're thrilled to launch our brand new website! It's been a while since we've had a proper home on the web, and we're excited to finally have a place to share news, music, photos, and everything Scratchy Fish.

The band is more energized and committed than ever. We've been woodshedding hard and the creative juices are flowing. Here's what's on the horizon:

**Hitting the Studio** - We'll be heading into the studio soon to lay down some new tracks. We've got a bunch of new material we can't wait to share with you.

**Live Shows** - Get ready to see us on stage again. We're lining up some gigs and can't wait to bring our sound to you in person.

Stay tuned, follow us on social media, and sign up for our mailing list to be the first to know when we drop new music and announce shows. 2026 is going to be a big year for Scratchy Fish!
