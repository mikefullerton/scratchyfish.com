      "bio_serious": "Phil Bernosky grew up under the spell of classical piano, thanks to his piano-teacher mom. But the real turning point hit when his brother blasted Billy Cobham, Maynard Ferguson, and Return to Forever—cue the \"What is this glorious madness?!\" moment. Phil dove headfirst into the dark side: jazz, fusion, and improv. Today, he's a seasoned keys player who's powered jazz, fusion, and funk bands across the Philadelphia scene and now lights up stages in the San Francisco Bay Area."

      "bio_silly": "It has been said that Mike was discovered in 1572 in the treacherous and the snow capped Lorne mountains of Flindrikin Scotland by a rambunctious (and comprehensively sloshed) football squad looking for an open pub (after a glorious victory on the pitch). That night, under an orange moon, Mike was heard in the distance playing traditional Highland Hochmagandy Polyrhythms with half chewed femur bones (from enormous sheep) on an elaborate arrangement of hollow and resonating shells of the (now extinct) Numpty Marsh Turtle. Legend holds that he was blootered on homemade fermented Bowfin Fruit Wine. All he would say when spoken to is \"I was born in 1518 in the village of Glenfinnan on the shores of Loch Shiel and I am immortal.\" He likes short walks on the beach, posing with fish in photographs, and he still plays Highland Hochmagandy Polyrhythms when he thinks no one is listening.",
